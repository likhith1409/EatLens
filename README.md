Eatlens is a project focused on image classification using PyTorch. It not only identifies objects in images but also provides nutritional details based on the recognized items using data from [Fruityvice API](https://www.fruityvice.com/).

## Overview

Eatlens utilizes deep learning techniques implemented in PyTorch to classify images into various categories such as fruits, vegetables, etc. Additionally, it extracts nutritional information for the identified objects from the Fruityvice API, providing users with insights into the health aspects of the recognized items.

## Features

- Image classification using PyTorch.
- Integration with Fruityvice API for fetching nutritional details.
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction.
- Scalable and extendable architecture for future improvements.
